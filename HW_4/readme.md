# WK_4 HW: First Drawing!

`This week I learned how to navigate the canvas and draw on it.`
  - Created my first drawing using:
    - Shapes
      -height
      -width
    - Color
    - Dots
    - Lines



1.I created a canvas, then I learned how to navigate the canvas as well as design upon it.`

2.My biggest problems were learning where the shapes and lines would end up on the canvas, especially when I created a new starting point to rotate a shape around.  I took the time to understand where points go and shapes end up on the canvas. I treated the canvas as if I was playing connect the dots. This helped learn where my next shape or line should go.`
