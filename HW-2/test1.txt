This is my first text document for one of Dr. Musick's Media Arts courses.

The document was created in Windows Command Prompt using the spell 'call>', not 'new-item' which really pissed me off for about 20 minutes. I almost blew out my large intestine.

I added a new line to this file in my text editor

I do not know how to open this file from my Command Prompt. I'm a clicker, for now.

Thus far, I have wasted hours in this class. I have faith I will understand it soon.
